# Exercise 08 - Calculator

The goal for this exercise is to create a calculator that does the following:

add, subtract, get the sum, multiply, get the power, and find the factorial

In order to do this please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to return the value so you can test it in Jest! To see the expected value
take a look at the spec file that houses the Jest test cases.

# Notes:
These are all in a module known as calculator (stand alone piece of code)
ADD - only takes in two numbers
- adds them together and return the sum of a+b added together.
- takes in integers only - format sum so it does addition and doesn't try to add two strings.
SUBTRACT
- same as add excepts subtracts b from a. 
MULTIPLY
- takes in an array and multiplies all the numbers together.
POWER
- same as add excepts calculates a to the power of b
SUM
- takes in an array and returns the sum of the result
FACTORIAL
- takes in 1 number. This number is the number to start the factorial
- count down to 1 i.e. if number is 5 then 5 factorial = 5*4*3*2*1
- 0 factorial is == to 1.
